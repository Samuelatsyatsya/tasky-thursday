YAGNI meaning "You Ain't Gonna Need It,"is a principle in software development that
     advises developers not to add stuff they dont really need until they actually do.
With this I think It's all about not overcomplicating things by only building features that's 
     necessary right now and avoiding future guesswork leading to more efficient development, 
     as it reduces unnecessary work and complexity.
